# How to play game?

    2. You need to install pygame:

# F.A.Q

    1. Why game doesn't work?
        Make sure you've done points placed upper;
        Check that all files placed in one directory;
        If it still doesn't work, contact me and send logs (by my bio's scoiety accounts);
    2. Why game shows incorrectly? (too small or too big)
        Go to pong_variables.py in downloaded directory and change params screen_width_workpiece & screen_height_workpiece
        as your monitor quality. Also you can choose your personal one, but make sure that aspect ratio is 16:9;
